# Contributing to Boomega

## To do
You can look at the [issues](https://github.com/Dansoftowner/Boomega/issues) list if you want to fix/add something.
Also, you can look for `// TODO:` messages in the source code.

## Writing code

You can use both `Java` and `Kotlin` for writing your code.  

Use the default formatting of your IDE for the code you write.  
Only format code that you are modifying, do not format entire classes at a time!  

You can use any JDK `16` with `JavaFX` modules for building the app.

## Commit messages

Use appropriate [gitmojies](https://gitmoji.dev/) in your commit messages.

Examples:  
`:sparkless: New record editor structure`  
`:lipstick: Update styles`  
`:bug: Fixed incorrect configuration saving policy`
