# boomega-export subproject

This subproject contains the Record Exporter API and the internal `RecordExporter` implementations that are 
responsible for exporting Boomega records into particular format (e.g. Json or Excel).

# :construction:

These APIs are **unstable** and need a tons of **refactoring**.  
The implementations are **untested**.
